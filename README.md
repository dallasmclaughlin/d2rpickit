# D2R Pickit Files

## Overview
These pickit files for Diablo 2 Resurrected focus on items that have consistent trading value on d2jsp mid-to-late in the ladder season. The collection is designed to help you efficiently identify valuable items while playing.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes charms, magic, rare, crafted, white/socketed, and unique items
- **Value-Focused**: Targets items with consistent trading value rather than just any high-level items
- **Flexible Filtering**: Many lines are commented out (starting with `//`) that represent "perfect" versions of items - uncomment these stricter rules when you want to be more selective
- **Well-Organized**: Files are separated by item quality and logically arranged by item type for easy maintenance

## Files Included
- `charms.nip` - Various charms including skillers with secondary stats
- `crafted.nip` - Valuable crafted items like caster amulets and blood gloves
- `magic.nip` - Magic items including jewels, circlets, and class-specific items
- `rare.nip` - Rare items with specific stat combinations
- `white.nip` - White/socketed items for valuable runewords
- `unique.nip` - Unique items with good/perfect rolls

## Usage
These files are compatible with loot filtering tools that support the NIP format. Simply add them to your pickit directory.

## Notes
- Threshold values are set at levels that generally represent items with trading value
- Consider uncommenting the "perfect" version lines as you accumulate wealth and want to be more selective
- Modify the stat thresholds to match your own preferences for item collection
